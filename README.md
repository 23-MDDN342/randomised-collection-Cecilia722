## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

**This is where you talk about your project!**

Randomness: In this learning experience, I encountered the concept of "randomness," which is a very interesting process. Initially, I often lost track of my visuals due to mistakes, because I didn't always realize in the beginning that I was adding random elements to my strawberries or leaves. However, after introducing more constraints and controllable variables, I realized how to control and correlate random parameters.

Drawing with Code: It was my first time using code to create all elements. Initially, I did get stuck for a long time, but after continuous attempts and learning, I gradually appreciated the benefits of this approach. After finishing the drawing, I could easily replace variables with controllable random conditions, which greatly increased my efficiency.

Limiting Randomness: In my code comments, I'm accustomed to labeling them as a kind of switch. Under specific conditions, the switch is triggered, giving my characters different expressions and many other elements.


face_code.js
Strawberry: Body + Sepals Leaves + Expression
Strawberry Flower: Body + Petals + Expression
Leaves: Three small leaves rotate to form into a big one


arrangement.js
Flip a vine four times and randomly draw a face in the center: 50% strawberry, 25% strawberry flower (and rotate), 25% leaves.
A vine, with strawberries, flowers, and leaves randomly changing shape on top.

edit0r.js

Flower Face: slider1-6
Strawberry Face:slider1-6
The Leaf: slider1-5


The teeth is off center because is not using rectMode(Center)
